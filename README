dvdcp - Copy a DVD title to disk
================================

This small utility copies a DVD title to disk. The user can select the data
streams to include in the copy. Output format is MPEG-TS, although that may
be changed pretty easily. ffmpeg/libav is used for the heavy lifting, while
libdvdread does the DVD access. Libdvdread can use libdvdcss2 for
decrypting.
